## What's Proxy?

Proxy is a client-server application that creates a SSL tunnel between two endpoints. The application of proxy is to facilitate access to Internet in different ways through a secure SSL tunnel. For example access  IPv6 and IPv4 Internet from different locations, those where the server side is running. Another use case is to access Internet using IPv6 (if your ISP has not stepped into 21st century and is stuck with IPv4 yet) creating a tunnel from an IPv4 machine to another IPv6 capable machine. That is, running the client side in an IPv4 box towards a server, somewhere else, with IPv6 connectivity -and double stack- gives automatic IPv6 connectivity to the client. Now you can enjoy IPv6. Other use cases are left to the imagination of the reader.
